----------FLASHMOD INFO----------
These builds of Rockbox have been modified to increase compatibility
with SD to Compact Flash adapters commonly used for iPod repair.

Downloads can be found in releases. The zips provided only contain
base firmware and not fonts/games; Download those from the utility
or the Rockbox site.

Two options were changed in these builds.

- HAVE_DISK_STORAGE to HAVE_FLASH_STORAGE

- HAVE_ATA_POWER_OFF disabled.

With Rockbox in a mature state any further updates will be at
new point releases.

It's likely problems with the CF adapter's interpretation of disk
spindown and power off commands cause the firmware to panic.
If I were to bet I'd say the "generic"/cheapo CF adapters don't
implement the ATA spec fully/perfectly. More expensive adapters/
real CF cards probably return success to any spinning disk related
commands.

Special thanks to a Reddit user going by "RattletraPM" whose comments
I found on a long ddg search for these solutions and spelt out what
options to change. I'm just building them :)

----BUGS----
- Battery indicator only updates at boot
- (!) Database doesn't save (Reported in a reddit thread, can't 
        reproduce)

----------ORIGINAL README----------
Build Your Own Rockbox

1. Clone 'rockbox' from git (or extract a downloaded archive).

   $ git clone git://git.rockbox.org/rockbox

     or

   $ tar xjf rockbox.tar.bz2

2. Create a build directory, preferably in the same directory as the firmware/
   and apps/ directories. This is where all generated files will be written.

   $ cd rockbox
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build

3. Make sure you have sh/arm/m68k-elf-gcc and siblings in the PATH. Make sure
   that you have 'perl' in your PATH too. Your gcc cross compiler needs to be
   a particular version depending on what player you are compiling for. These
   can be acquired with the rockboxdev.sh script in the /tools/ folder of the
   source, or will have been included if you've installed one of the
   toolchains or development environments provided at http://www.rockbox.org/

   $ which sh-elf-gcc
   $ which perl

4. In your build directory, run the 'tools/configure' script and enter what
   target you want to build for and if you want a debug version or not (and a
   few more questions). It'll prompt you. The debug version is for making a
   gdb version out of it. It is only useful if you run gdb towards your target
   Archos.

   $ ../tools/configure

5. *ploink*. Now you have got a Makefile generated for you.

6. Run 'make' and soon the necessary pieces from the firmware and the apps
   directories have been compiled, linked and scrambled for you.

   $ make
   $ make zip

7. unzip the rockbox.zip on your music player, reboot it and
   *smile*.

If you want to build for more than one target, just create several build
directories and create a setup for each target:

   $ mkdir build-fmrecorder
   $ cd build-fmrecorder
   $ ../tools/configure

   $ mkdir build-player
   $ cd build-player
   $ ../tools/configure
